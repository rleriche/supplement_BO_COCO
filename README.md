## Supplementary material to the article "Revisiting Bayesian Optimization in the light of the COCO benchmark"
by Rodolphe Le Riche and Victor Picheny

The following subdirectories contain all the results of a COCO postprocessing of optimization algorithms benchmarks. In each subdirectory, index.html is a handy way to navigate through the plots and tables.

### List of subdirectories with content summary
* InitialDoEsize : tests on the initial size of the DoE (S / M / L versions of the algorithms)
* Kernel : exponential versus Mat√©rn kernel (ExpS/ExpM/ExpL vs S/M/L)
