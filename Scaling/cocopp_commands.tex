Bootstrapped empirical cumulative distribution of the number of objective function evaluations divided by dimension (FEvals/DIM) for all functions and subgroups in #1-D. The targets are chosen from $10^{[-8..2]}$ such that the reference algorithm just not reached them within a given budget of $k$ $\times$ DIM, with $8$ different values of $k$ chosen equidistant in logscale within the interval $\{0.5, \dots, 50\}$. As reference algorithm, the reference algorithm is shown as light thick line with diamond markers.

Expected running time (\ERT\ in number of $f$-evaluations
                        as $\log_{10}$ value) divided by dimension versus dimension. The target function value
                        is chosen such that the reference algorithm just failed to achieve
                        an \ERT\ of $10\times\DIM$. Different symbols correspond to different algorithms given in the legend of #1. Light symbols give the maximum number of function evaluations from the longest trial divided by dimension. Black stars indicate a statistically better result compared to all other algorithms with $p<0.01$ and Bonferroni correction number of dimensions (six).

        Expected runtime (\ERT\ in number of function 
        evaluations) divided by the respective the \ERT\ of the reference algorithm in
        #1.
        This \ERT\ ratio and, in braces as dispersion measure, the half difference between
        10 and 90\%-tile of bootstrapped run lengths appear for each algorithm and 
        %
        run-length based target, the corresponding reference \ERT\
        (preceded by the target \Df-value in \textit{italics}) in the first row. 
        \#succ is the number of trials that reached the target value of the last column.
        %
        The median number of conducted function evaluations is additionally given in 
        \textit{italics}, if the target in the last column was never reached.
        Entries, succeeded by a star, are statistically significantly better (according to
        the rank-sum test) when compared to all other algorithms of the table, with
        $p = 0.05$ or $p = 10^{-k}$ when the number $k$ following the star is larger
        than 1, with Bonferroni correction by the number of functions (24). A $\downarrow$ indicates the same tested against the reference algorithm. Best results are printed in bold.
